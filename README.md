Introduction
-------------

Starter C++ project with Travis integration.

Students can use this to add any number of .h/.cpp files.

The general-purpose Makefile is courtesy of https://sourceforge.net/projects/gcmakefile/.
I chose this one because it is easy to customize and would be ideal for introductory CS classes based on C/C++.

This starter project also shows how to include commonly used libraries like Boost. 
See .travis.yml for how to install additional packages.
You basically need to know the Ubuntu package name and simply list it in the **apt:** section.
